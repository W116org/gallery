Never opened a transmission in my life, let alone an auto, works perfectly, like a champ, and doesnt loose a drop. Only made 1 mistake, and that was distroying 2 $4.50 rubber seals in the reassembly stage, which were easy to change."

  comment: "6.9 dry sump oil hoses. - The fittings are simply screwed in, initially into the collar and then into the hose itself. the fitting is tapered, starts off narrow and expands towards the end, dead simple. Disasembled all 6 fittings on mine, cleaned them out and resealed them with high temperature oil gasket maker, these hose fittings will never leak again. The hose rubber itself is in excellent condition for its age. I certainly cant imagine getting the hose itself would be that hard in this mining rich state."

Here you see the dry and hard O-Ring around the edge of the pump housing, This was a major leak area on my transmission. I'm also replacing the radial seal at the front of the pump which mates to the torque converter, it didnt leak, but its cheap and its easy to access now - not later when it does."

Console is original stain.  \r\nAshtray which was rubbed back to bare wood has a mix of Jarrah and WalnutBrown applied over each other. \r\nThe minor difference is the ashtray has a tad more red compared to the browner console.

  comment: "My first 6.9, body was a bit tatty (rust and bog), converted from LHD to RHD at some time in its life. European not USA origin, I'd say: velour, not leather, no sunroof, no wood on centre console, etc. Picture taken late 93 - mid 94 I think. Believe the car is now in Rockingham, south of Perth."
